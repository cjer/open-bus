# OpenBus Roadmap

## Project Mission and Summary
Open Bus is a project of The Public Knowledge Workshop. We use public data to improve public transport in Israel.

## Goals for OpenBus
### Real-Delay - QoS Score
*Create a QoS (Quality-of-Service) score for public transport that can be viewed and sliced by agency, route, trip, stop, date and time.*  
*Compare GTFS trips to SIRI trips*
-   Meta-QoS - How good / bad is our SIRI data? Missing data, wrong data
-   Compare stats (route level only, easier and might be good enough for most uses):
	-   Trip counts
	-   Headway
-   Align trips and compare per station
	-   Match SIRI trip to GTFS trip - How?
		-   Our current method is using origin_aimed_departure_time, route and date ([source](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/blob/0fd5222b12a6062da7072972e89c4fc2e1aa47a0/postgres/adding_trip_id_to_siri_from_gtfs.sql#L44))
		-   New trip_id field in SIRI?
		-   What are we missing? Test both
	-   Compare / Diff the trips -
		-   Define the measurements -    
			-   Actual arrival time at planned stops as compared to the schedule	    
			-   Departure - Yes / No → When?   
		-   Munge both data to a clean dataset for doing the stats    
			-   Infer arrival time at stop using the SIRI responses	    
			-   Loop lines issue - how big is it?
		-   Aggregate and enable drilldown
-   How to handle changes over time -
	-   Try to build an incremental database we can query?    
	-   Or, work directrly with GTFS files, use them for stats every day, and when we need something historical we’ll just go over the files one by one.
-   Fuse with complaint data.
-   Questions
	-   What to do with out of schedule trips?
### Accessibility Score
*Show how accessible are different locations and resources by public transport?*  
-   Phase 1 - GTFS only
-   Phase 2 - Actual arrival times, depends on Real Delay progress
-   Between Locations -
	-   Choose meaningful locations
	-   How to set the borders and granularity? (GIS data…)
	-   Determine which lines or stops service each location
-   Between Locations and Resources
	-   Get data for resources - OSM, CBS (למ”ס), Google, Municipal data
	-   Initial example: [http://simplistic.me/urbanaccess-tel-aviv-demo.html](http://simplistic.me/urbanaccess-tel-aviv-demo.html)
-   Between Populations and Resources
-   Future - compare to private car or other means of transportation
### Complaints
*Work with 15-minutes on building a good complaint platform. Use the data for analysis.*  
-   Complaint Analysis - search, statistics, monitoring and alerting
-   Fuse with GTFS and SIRI data
-   Complaint Management - CRM style
-   Automatic Filing to MOT and other Agencies
-   Improve app and site UX/UI and data
-   Scrape Social Media for more data
### Website
*A suitable space to throw our stuff in*
-   Slice and dice
-   Map
-   Blog
### Misc
-   Analyze Incentives for using private car (public & private sector)
-   Get archive data from MOT (בקשות חופש מידע) and possibly from the agencies
-   Better future Open Data policies for transportation in Israel (work with תחבורה היום ומחר)
-   Better arrival time prediction

## Milestones
TODO: Fill these up after working through the goals
Short term - things we are working on now (but could always use help with)  
Medium term - things contributors can start working on that is not currently being worked on  
Long term - describe where our project is going (see Goals)  
** Sync these with the builtin git Milestones, and then every issue could be linked to a specific milestone**

## Specify Tasks
-   Goals → Milestones → Tasks → Issues  
Create an issue for each task. Take time to describe the task along with why you are doing this task. This will strengthen the vision for the project and help others get involved.

Tips for issues: Include as much context and help as possible! Add links, mention specific people involved by their username (i.e. @cjer). Articulate the problem or idea along with solutions and next steps.

Link to these issues in your Roadmap under each milestone.
